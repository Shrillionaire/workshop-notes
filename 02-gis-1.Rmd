# Single-Dataset GIS Operations

## Learning Objectives

- Become familiar with several common single-dataset GIS operations
- Calculate centroids of polygons
- Create buffers
- Explore additional single-dataset GIS operations

## Functions Learned
- `st_geometry()`
- `st_centroid()`

## Exercises

- Project 1986 ward data into correct UTM projection
- Cast ward data to "POLYGON" with `st_cast`
- Calculate centroids of wards with `st_centroid`
- Calculate bounding box with `st_bbox`
- Plot centroids, buffered centroids, and wards for each year
