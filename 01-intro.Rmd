# Introduction to Spatial Data

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between vector and raster data
- Describe some common packages in R for handling spatial data, and what each do
- Be able to import spatial data into R (make sure everything is installed) and describe the dataset: what is the CRS, is it point/polygon/line?

## 3 main ways to store spatial data in R

- `sf`
- `sp`
- `raster`: for raster data - we won't work with this too much during the workshop

## Exercises

- Review vector v. raster, components of the CRS, and how those are stored in a PROJ4 string
- Import ward data using `st_read`
- Project data and look at CRS using `st_transform` and `st_crs`
- Compare and describe CRS
- Repeat entire process with next year's ward data
