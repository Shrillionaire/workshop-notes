# Project Setup {-}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Goal {-}

- Set up a directory on your computer to store scripts and data for workshop
- Back up all workshop materials online using Github

## All-purpose project workflow with Git {-}

### Prerequisites {-}

- You have a Github account. If not, [create one here](https://github.com/).
- You have Git on your computer. Check by typing `git --version` in the Terminal pane in RStudio.
- You have configured Git. Check by typing `git config --list` in the Terminal pane in RStudio. If you have not configured git, follow [these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)


1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and create a new repository. Choose a public or private folder (your choice). Initialize with a README.
2. Open RStudio. Click "New Project". Click "Version Control". Paste the URL of the repository you just created.
3. Create the following folders in your project by clicking on "New Folder" in the Files pane in RStudio:

- `data`
- `doc`
- `scripts`

Put data in `data`, written output in `doc`, and R code scripts in `scripts`.

4. Once you've put data and scripts in, you can back up your documents by going to the tab in RStudio called "Git".

- Check the checkbox next to the items you'd like to back up.
- Click "Commit". Type an informative message, i.e. "Added materials from first workshop".
- Click "Push". You have now uploaded your files to Github. If you go to the web link of the repository you created on Github, your materials should now be there.
