Workshops are held on Tuesdays at noon during Winter Quarter 2019. Our goal for running these workshops are to teach researchers how to work effectively with spatial data in R. You are welcome to join us in Searle 240B for workshops if you’re a member of the UChicago campus community! Workshop Organization Each chapter of this bookdown book represents a 1-hour workshop taught at the center. Chapters will be uploaded a day before the workshop so you can review the material prior to attending. Scripts from the workshops will be uploaded to Github following each workshop, link coming shortly. Data used in the workshops can be found on the GeoDa Center data website, and will be linked to in each workshop chapter. All data will eventually be found in an R package developed by the CSDS. Prior Knowledge We assume that workshop attendees have used RStudio and are familiar with the basics of R. If you need a refresher, this R for Social Scientists tutorial developed by Data Carpentry is a good place to start. Additionally, Luc Anselin’s introductory R lab notes can be found on the CSDS Tutorials page. Topics We plan to cover the following topics: Spatial data formats Projections Spatial data handling Spatial data operations Static maps Interactive maps Organization of research projects Reproducible research with R Additional information Workshops are run by Angela Li, R Spatial Advocate for the CSDS.
