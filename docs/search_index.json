Workshops are held on Tuesdays at noon during Winter Quarter 2019. Our goal for running these workshops are to teach researchers how to work effectively with spatial data in R. You are welcome to join us in Searle 240B for workshops if you’re a member of the UChicago campus community! Bring a laptop to follow along. Additionally, please fill out the following short survey if you plan to attend the workshop this quarter. Workshop Organization Each chapter of this bookdown book represents a 1-hour workshop taught at the center. Chapters will be uploaded a day before the workshop so you can review the material prior to attending. Scripts from the workshops will be uploaded to Github following each workshop, link coming shortly. Data used in the workshops can be found on the GeoDa Center data website, and will be linked to in each workshop chapter. All data will eventually be found in an R package developed by the CSDS. Prior Knowledge We assume that workshop attendees have used RStudio and are familiar with the basics of R. If you need a refresher, this R for Social Scientists tutorial developed by Data Carpentry is a good place to start. Additionally, Luc Anselin’s introductory R lab notes can be found on the CSDS Tutorials page. Topics We plan to cover the following topics: Spatial data formats Projections Spatial data handling Spatial data operations Static maps Interactive maps Organization of research projects Reproducible research with R Additional information Workshops are run by Angela Li, R Spatial Advocate for the CSDS. If you have any questions about the following material, please reach out to her at ali6@uchicago.edu.

["project-setup.html", "Project Setup Prerequisites for Git workflow Workflow with Git Workflow without Git Additional reading", " Project Setup The goal of this section is to help you: Set up a directory on your computer to store scripts and data for this workshop Back up all workshop materials online using Github Prerequisites for Git workflow You have a Github account. If not, create one here. You have Git on your computer. Check by typing git --version in the Terminal pane in RStudio. Macs should already have Git, Windows will need to install Git Bash on their computer. You have configured Git. Check by typing git config --list in the Terminal pane in RStudio. If you have not configured git, follow these instructions. Workflow with Git Go to github.com and create a new repository. Choose a public or private folder (your choice). Initialize with a README. Open RStudio. Click “New Project”. Click “Version Control”. Paste the URL of the repository you just created. Create the following folders in your project by clicking on “New Folder” in the Files pane in RStudio: data doc scripts Put data in data, written output in doc, and R code scripts in scripts. Once you’ve put data and scripts in, you can back up your documents by going to the tab in RStudio called “Git”. Check the checkbox next to the items you’d like to back up. Click “Commit”. Type an informative message, i.e. “Added materials from first workshop”. Click “Push”. You have now uploaded your files to Github. If you go to the web link of the repository you created on Github, your materials should now be there. Workflow without Git Open RStudio. Click “New Project”. Click “New Directory”. Create the following folders in your project by clicking on “New Folder” in the Files pane in RStudio: data doc scripts Put data in data, written output in doc, and R code scripts in scripts.
